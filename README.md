This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About Project :eyes:
POC for sending email messages using the [**Nodemailer**](https://nodemailer.com/about/) module for Node.js.
The project by default uses **gmail** as a service and **OAuth** security which has been configured in the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/home) as can be seen in the transporter object:
```sh
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: "gmail",
    auth: {
      type: "OAuth2",
      user: process.env.MAIL_USERNAME,
      pass: process.env.MAIL_PASSWORD,
      clientId: process.env.OAUTH_CLIENTID,
      clientSecret: process.env.OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET,
      refreshToken: process.env.OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN,
    },
  });
```
but you can easily change it and use the configuration with your custom domain info(host, port, user and password):
```sh
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: 'something.yourdomain.com',
    port: 465,
    secure: true, // true for 465, false for other ports
    auth: {
      user: 'username@yourdomain.com', // your domain email address
      pass: 'password' // your password
    }
  });
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
